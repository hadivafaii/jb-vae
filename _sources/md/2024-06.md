Summary
===============================

Summary of progress in June 2024

- Wrote up the document. Implementation requries a lot of work. Some nice innovations on the theory side.
- Writing linear lateral dynamics on membrane potentials gives us gain modulation for the firing rates.
- We decided to first solve the iterative aspect. That alone, plus the adaptive encoder, is a paper (hopefully ICLR).
- Then we will move on to add the hierarchy.
